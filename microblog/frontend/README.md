# Microblog Frontend Documentation

## Overview

This is the frontend application for the Microblog project, a social media platform that allows users to post and interact with tweets. The frontend is built using React and TypeScript, providing a modern and responsive user interface.

## Getting Started

To get started with the frontend application, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd microblog/frontend
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

To run the frontend application in development mode, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

### Building for Production
